annote = {Complexity: Measure of competitiveness

Level of technology determines the products countries can produce

Its about the link between export basket and industrial competitiveness

Interesting that it is a non-monetary measure for product complexity

4: the metrics is about competitivenesss, not technology


Difference to HH
------------------

Example: China ranks great here, but not so good in HH

HH: country rank depends on average quality of the oroducts exported; no matter the level of diversification
=> uses only product complexity to determine country complexity
==> the export of products with lower complexity reduces country complexity because averages are used
==> But it may be useful to export them because of diversification

Pietro: larger fitness - more diversified export - larger quality of exported goods
=> uses product complexity and diversification to determine country complexity
==> Exporting products of low complexity simply has a negligible effect on country complexity, and does not represent a handicap

Figure 4 shows differences, and these differences are really substantive

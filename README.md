# Do the "smart kids" catch up? Technological capabilities, globalisation and economic growth 

[Claudius Gräbner](https://claudius-graebner.com), [Philipp Heimberger](https://wiiw.ac.at/philipp-heimberger-s-1138.html), and [Jakob Kapeller](https://jakob-kapeller.org/)

Here we provide all the data and the code to replicate all empirical exercises in the abovementioned paper.
A working paper version can be found [here](https://www.uni-due.de/imperia/md/content/soziooekonomie/ifsowp9_ghk2020.pdf).
You may cite the paper as follows:

To replicate all results from the paper navigate to the root folder as your working directory 
(i.e. the folder where `eci-growth.Rproj` is located) and call the following from your termial:

```
zsh code/make_tables.sh 
```

replacing `zsh` with your preferred shell.

Of course, we are glad for any constructive comments - critical as well as supportive.
You can reach us via [email](https://claudius-graebner.com/contact-1.html) or, preferably, via the Github issue tracker of this project.
Thank you very much!
